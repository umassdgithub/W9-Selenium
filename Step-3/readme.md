**Code Explanation:**

**1. Import Required Modules:**

```javascript
const { Builder, By, Key, until } = require('selenium-webdriver');
```

- This line imports necessary modules from the `selenium-webdriver` package. These modules provide functionality for interacting with web elements, navigating, handling alerts, etc.

1. Builder:
    - This module provides a builder for creating new WebDriver instances. 
    - You can use the `forBrowser` method to specify the browser to use.

2. By:
    - This module provides a selector for locating web elements. 
    - You can use the `By` class to specify the type of selector and the value of the selector.
3. Key:
    - This module provides a set of constants for representing keyboard keys. 
    - You can use the `Key` class to specify the type of key and the value of the key.
4. until:
    - This module provides a set of constants for representing wait conditions.
    - You can use the `until` class to specify the type of wait condition and the value of the wait condition.

**2. Define Test Suite:**
```javascript
describe('Your Test Suite Name', function() {
    // Test cases will be defined here
});
```

- This block defines a test suite using Mocha's `describe` function. You should replace `'Your Test Suite Name'` with an appropriate name for your test suite.

**3. Setup and Teardown:**

```javascript
before(async function() {
    driver = await new Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
});

after(async function() {
    await driver.quit();
});
```

- These functions are executed before and after running the test suite, respectively.
- In the `before` function, a WebDriver instance is created using `Builder`, specifying the browser ('chrome' in this case).
- In the `after` function, the WebDriver instance is closed using `quit()` to clean up resources.

**4. Test Cases:**

```javascript
it('Should interact with select element', async function() {
    // Test case code here
});

it('Should click on submit button', async function() {
    // Test case code here
});

// Additional test cases...
```

- Each `it` block represents a test case (this is similar to Jest's `test` block). Inside these blocks, you define the steps of the test case.
- The first parameter of `it` is a description of the test case.
- The second parameter is an asynchronous function containing the test steps.

**5. Example Test Case: Interacting with a Select Element:**

```javascript
it('Should interact with select element', async function() {
    let select = await driver.findElement(By.tagName("select"));
    let selectElement = await new Select(select);
    await selectElement.deselectAll();
    await selectElement.selectByVisibleText("Edam");
    // Your assertions here
});
```

- This test case demonstrates interacting with a select element.
- It finds the select element using `findElement`, then creates a `Select` object to interact with it.
- It deselects all options and then selects an option by its visible text.
- You should replace `'Edam'` with the text of the option you want to select.

**6. Additional Test Cases:**

- The other test cases follow a similar structure, covering different actions such as clicking a button, switching between windows and frames, handling alerts, and navigating to URLs.
- Each test case is named descriptively to indicate the action being tested.
